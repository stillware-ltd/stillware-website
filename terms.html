        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 26, 2025</p>
        <p>Welcome to Zeroed! By accessing or using the Zeroed application ("App"), executing a purchase, or using any
            of our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these
            Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. License to Use</h2>
        <p>Stillware Ltd grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download, install,
            and use the App strictly in accordance with these Terms.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Ownership of Data:</strong> As described in our Privacy Policy, Zeroed is a local-first
                application. You retain full ownership of your financial data stored on your device and in your personal
                Cloud storage.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Pro and Universal Licenses</h2>
        <p>Zeroed offers paid licenses ("Pro" or "Universal Bundle") which grant access to premium features.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lifetime License:</strong> A one-time payment option that grants access to the specified version
                of the App indefinitely. This does not necessarily include major version upgrades (e.g., v2.0) released
                in the future, unless explicitly stated.</li>
            <li><strong>Founder's Status:</strong> Users who obtain a license as part of the "Founder's Offer" (limited
                to the
                first 500 users) are granted "Founder Status," which exempts them from future paywalls for version 1.x
                features.</li>
            <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Refunds are handled by the respective platform (Apple App Store, Google Play
                Store, or Lemon Squeezy) according to their refund policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You agree not to, and you will not permit others to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>License, sell, rent, lease, assign, distribute, transmit, host, outsource, disclose, or otherwise
                commercially exploit the App or make the App available to any third party.</li>
            <li>Modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, decrypt, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of
                the App.</li>
            <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notice (including any notice of copyright or trademark) of
                Stillware Ltd or its affiliates, partners, suppliers, or the licensors of the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The App, including without limitation all copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other
            intellectual property rights are, and shall remain, the sole and exclusive property of Stillware Ltd.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App may display, include, or make available third-party content (including data, information,
            applications, and other products services) or provide links to third-party websites or services
            ("Third-Party Services").</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that Stillware Ltd shall not be responsible for any Third-Party Services, including
            their accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality, or any
            other aspect thereof.</p>

        <h2>6. NO WARRANTY</h2>
        <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" AND WITH ALL FAULTS AND DEFECTS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
            KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, STILLWARE LTD EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
            WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
            MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Stillware Ltd or its suppliers be liable
            for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
            damages for loss of profits, for loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal
            injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the App,
            third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the App, or otherwise in connection with any
            provision of this Agreement), even if Stillware Ltd or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of
            such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>Stillware Ltd reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a
            revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What
