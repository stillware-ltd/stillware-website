        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 26, 2025</p>
        <p>Zeroed ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. We believe that your financial data
            belongs to you. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and maintained by the
            Zeroed application.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Core Principle: Local First</strong></p>
            <p>Zeroed is a local-first application. This means your financial transactions, budgets, and account
                balances are stored directly on your device. We (the developers) do not have access to your personal
                financial data.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <h3>Personal Financial Data</h3>
        <p>Your financial data (payees, categories, transactions, amounts) is stored locally on your device in an
            encrypted database. We do not transmit this data to our own servers.</p>
        <h3>Data Synchronization (Google Drive)</h3>
        <p>Zeroed offers an optional cross-platform synchronization feature using your personal Google Drive account.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> If you verify your "Universal Bundle" or choose to sync, the app uploads
                an encrypted copy of your database to a folder named <code>ZeroedData</code> in your Google Drive.</li>
            <li><strong>Our Access:</strong> We utilize the <code>drive.file</code> scope, which grants the app access
                <em>only</em> to the files created by the app itself. <strong>We cannot view, edit, or delete any other
                    files in your Google Drive.</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Your Control:</strong> You maintain full control and ownership of this data. You can delete the
                <code>ZeroedData</code> folder from your Google Drive at any time to remove your synced data.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Receipt Scanning</h3>
        <p>Zeroed uses on-device Machine Learning (Google ML Kit) to scan receipts for text. This processing happens
            entirely on your phone. No images or text extracted from receipts are sent to our servers.</p>
        <h3>Support Communications</h3>
        <p>When you contact us for support, we receive your email address and any information you voluntarily provide
            (such as screenshots or logs). We use this information strictly to assist you and resolve your inquiry.</p>
        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use trusted third-party services for specific operational functionalities. These services may collect data
            as governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used to manage subscriptions and purchase history. RevenueCat may collect
                anonymous App User IDs and purchase receipts to validate your "Pro" or "Universal" status.</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon Squeezy:</strong> Used for processing payments for the Desktop version. They act as the
                Merchant of Record and handle your payment information securely. We do not store your credit card
                details.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Drive API:</strong> Used solely for the purpose of syncing your encrypted data between
                your own devices.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>Since we do not host your data, we cannot "delete" your account in the traditional sense because we do not
            have it.</p>
        <p><strong>To completely remove your data:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Delete the Zeroed application from your device(s). This removes the local database.</li>
            <li>Log in to your Google Drive and delete the folder named <code>ZeroedData</code>. This removes the cloud
                backup.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We prioritize the security of your information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Encryption:</strong> Your database is encrypted on-device.</li>
            <li><strong>Transit Security:</strong> All communication with Google Drive and third-party services occurs
                over secure HTTPS (SSL/TLS) connections.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Zeroed does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13. The app
            is a utility for personal finance management intended for general audiences.</p>
        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.</p>
        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
